//! HTTP fetching utilities.
//!
//! This module exposes [`Fetch`], a configurable HTTP request builder. It holds the default configuration (headers,
//! retries, HTTP/2 toggle) and sends requests via [`Fetch::text`] (raw body) or [`Fetch::json`] (deserialized into a
//! caller-chosen type), retrying with Fibonacci backoff. [`Fetch::download`] instead streams a response body to a file
//! and returns a [`Download`] handle immediately, exposing live progress as a [`Progress`] snapshot (and surfacing
//! failures as a [`DownloadError`]). Individual requests can override the defaults — including attaching a JSON request
//! body — by passing [`RequestOptions`].
