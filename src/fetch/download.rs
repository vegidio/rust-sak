//! Streaming file downloads with live progress tracking.
//!
//! [`Fetch::download`](super::Fetch::download) streams a response body to disk in a background task and returns a
//! [`Download`] handle immediately. Callers read live progress through [`Download::progress`] (a [`Progress`]
//! snapshot), poll [`Download::completed`]/[`Download::failed`], await updates with [`Download::changed`], or await the
//! final [`Result`] with [`Download::join`]. Progress is shared over a [`tokio::sync::watch`] channel — the background
//! task is the single producer, the handle is the observer.
//!
//! When a file already exists at the target path, [`DownloadMode`] decides the behavior: [`DownloadMode::Resume`] (the
//! default) continues an incomplete transfer via an HTTP `Range` request, [`DownloadMode::Overwrite`] truncates and
//! re-downloads, and [`DownloadMode::Skip`] leaves the existing file untouched.
